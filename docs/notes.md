## Lecture Notes

Personal lecture notes from the BSc in Mathematical & Computing Sciences for AI (BAI) at Bocconi. 

???+ info "Differential Geometry"
    **Description**  
    Introductory notes on submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$. I added some extra material (e.g. Fenchel  Transform).

## Material for Math Olympiads

Some handouts I curated during my Olympiad period. 

???+ tip "Complex Roots of Unity in Math Olympiads"
    **Description**  
    This work shows how complex roots of unity serve as an elegant bridge connecting the core areas of Olympiad mathematics: algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics.
