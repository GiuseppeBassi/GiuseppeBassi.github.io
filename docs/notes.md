## Lecture Notes

These notes are my personal lecture notes for the BSc in Mathematical & Computing Sciences for AI (BAI) at Bocconi.  
They aim to be concise, proof-oriented, and continuously updated as the courses progress. Small inaccuracies may occur — if you spot one, feel free to reach out by email.

## Material for Math Olympiads

Short write-ups and handouts I prepared/curated during my Olympiad period. They focus on techniques and patterns that appear frequently in problems.

???+ tip "Complex Roots of Unity in Math Olympiads"
    **Description**  
    A technique-oriented handout on using complex roots of unity in combinatorics and number theory problems (filters, roots-of-unity filter, symmetry arguments, and examples).

    **Notes & Updates**  
    - **Current version:** 24 Sep 2025  
    - **Changelog:**  
      - *24 Sep 2025* — Initial public release; added examples on counting with the roots-of-unity filter.
