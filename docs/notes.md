## Material for Math Olympiads

Some handouts I curated during my Olympiad period. 

???+ tip "Complex Roots of Unity in Math Olympiads"
    **Description**  
    This work shows how complex roots of unity serve as an elegant bridge connecting the core areas of Olympiad mathematics: algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics.
